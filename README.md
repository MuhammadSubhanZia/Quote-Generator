# ✨ Quote Generator by Subhan Zia

Welcome to **Quote Generator**, a creative and dynamic project built with care, passion, and a hunger to explore new tools and technologies. This isn't just a simple quote display app it's an aesthetic experience powered by animation, color, and interactivity.

## 🌟 Motivation Behind the Project

This project started with a simple idea: to present **meaningful quotes beautifully**.

But for me, Subhan Zia, it was more than just quotes. It was about stepping into a new territory using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **ShadCN UI**, and many more modern web development tools that I hadn't used before.

Alhamdulillah, this journey became a practical playground where I explored:
- ✨ Animations with floating emojis
- 🎨 Dynamic UI with Tailwind and custom gradients
- 🎯 Topic-based quote rendering
- 💡 SSR handling and performance tuning
